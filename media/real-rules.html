    ⚠️ <b>1.</b> Follow Discord terms of service and community guidelines first and foremost. Violations of Terms will result in an instant ban, because this applies everywhere across discord and keeps people safe.<br>

    <br>
    ☮️ <b>1.</b> Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no doxxing, witch hunting, sexism, racism, anti-LGBTQ+ comments, or hate speech will be tolerated. Certain offensive words are censored, and attempts to evade the filter will result in punishment. Do not use slurs.<br>
    <br>
    😺 <b>2.</b> Be kind to people. Do not start fights or arguments in the server for no reason. Don't be an asshole.<br>
    <br>
    🛡️ <b>3.</b> Admins reserve the right to make decisions above everyone else, and if an issue is not resolved, let an admin or moderator handle it.<br>
    <br>
    💬 <b>4.</b> Use the correct channels. Do not overly spam in any channel other than #bots-n-spam, and keep bot commands restricted to that channel only. Do not spam ping or annoy people via spam. Do not mass-ping. If people are not following the rules in a text channel, ping a moderator.<br>
    <br>
    🔊 <b>5.</b> Do not mute others in voice channels unless they are being overly annoying. Respect the mood of the channel and do not "earrape" or scream unnecessarily. If people are not following the rules in a voice call, ping a moderator.<br>
    <br>
    👍 <b>6.</b> Keep the chat and conversations generally lighthearted. We are a joke/memes server, so please refrain from excessive venting or heavy topics like suicide.<br>
    <br>
    🚫 <b>7.</b> NSFW or obscene imagery, or overly sexual text/content is not permitted anywhere in the server. This includes gore or disgusting content. If you are unsure whether to post something, you probably should not post it.<br>
    <br>
    👀 <b>8.</b> If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let an admin or moderator know by pinging them. Do not falsely ping admins or mods without reason.<br>
    <br>
    💵 <b>9.</b> Advertising is not allowed unless you make something worth checking out, in which case send in #creations. Feel free to send art or creations in #genreal too, but advertising in #genreal is not allowed at all. Discord server advertising or advertising paid services is also not allowed ever.<br>
